# AI Chatbot Integration for Blurr HR Portal

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of an AI chatbot for the Blurr HR Portal that provides intelligent assistance for employees and managers. The chatbot can answer questions about tasks, projects, employee information, and help with navigation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Chat Interface Component** (`src/components/chatbot/chat-interface.tsx`)

   - Modern floating chat widget
   - Message history display
   - Input handling with send button
   - Responsive design with shadcn/ui components

2. **Message System** (`src/lib/chatbot-actions.ts`)

   - Message processing and storage
   - AI response generation
   - Context management

3. **AI Response Engine** (`src/lib/ai-responses.ts`)

   - Natural language processing for queries
   - Integration with existing data models
   - Context-aware responses

4. **Data Integration Layer**
   - Direct access to employee, project, and task data
   - Real-time information retrieval
   - Permission-based data access

## Features

### 1. Task and Project Assistance

- Query task status and assignments
- Get project information and progress
- Task creation assistance
- Status update guidance

### 2. Employee Information

- Employee lookup by name or ID
- Department and role information
- Contact details (when authorized)

### 3. Navigation Help

- Guide users to specific pages
- Feature explanations
- Workflow assistance

### 4. Data Integration

- Real-time access to database
- Permission-based information sharing
- Contextual responses based on user role

## Technical Implementation

### Data Models

```typescript
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  role: "user" | "assistant";
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
}

interface ChatSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### AI Response Categories

1. **Task Queries**

   - "What tasks are assigned to me?"
   - "What's the status of project X?"
   - "Who is working on task Y?"

2. **Employee Queries**

   - "Find employee John Smith"
   - "Who is in the development team?"
   - "What's the contact for HR?"

3. **Navigation Help**

   - "How do I create a new task?"
   - "Where can I see my salary information?"
   - "How to update project status?"

4. **General Information**
   - System capabilities
   - Help documentation
   - Feature explanations

### Security Considerations

- User authentication required
- Role-based data access
- No sensitive information exposure
- Audit logging for queries
