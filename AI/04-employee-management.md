# Employee Management System - Blurr HR Portal

## Overview

The Employee Management System provides comprehensive CRUD operations for managing employees within the Blurr HR Portal. This system includes data validation, server actions, UI components, and proper error handling.

## Architecture

### 1. Data Layer

- **Database Schema**: Employee model with relationships to User and SalaryRecord
- **Prisma Integration**: Type-safe database operations
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for client and server-side validation

### 2. Server Layer

- **Server Actions**: Next.js server actions for CRUD operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper status codes
- **Security**: User authentication and authorization checks

### 3. Client Layer

- **React Components**: Modern UI components using shadcn/ui
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form with Zod validation
- **State Management**: React state with proper loading states

## Implementation Details

### Employee Data Model

```typescript
interface Employee {
  id: string;
  employeeId: string; // Custom employee ID (e.g., EMP001)
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  joiningDate: Date;
  basicSalary: number;
  department?: string;
  position?: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  userId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Validation Schemas

**Client-side validation** (forms):

- Employee creation and update forms
- Real-time validation feedback
- Custom validation rules

**Server-side validation** (API):

- Data sanitization
- Business rule validation
- Security checks

### Server Actions

1. **createEmployee**: Creates new employee with validation
2. **getEmployees**: Retrieves employees with pagination and filtering
3. **getEmployee**: Gets single employee by ID
4. **updateEmployee**: Updates employee data with validation
5. **deleteEmployee**: Soft delete employee (sets isActive to false)

### UI Components

1. **EmployeeForm**: Create/edit employee form with validation
2. **EmployeeList**: Table view with sorting, filtering, and pagination
3. **EmployeeCard**: Card view for employee display
4. **EmployeeDetails**: Detailed view of employee information
5. **EmployeeActions**: Action buttons for edit/delete operations

### Features Implemented

- ✅ Complete CRUD operations
- ✅ Form validation with Zod
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Responsive design with shadcn/ui
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Bulk operations
- ✅ Export functionality
- ✅ Role-based access control

## Security Considerations

- User authentication required for all operations
- Users can only manage employees they created
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma
- XSS protection through proper data handling

## Performance Optimizations

- Pagination for large datasets
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- React Server Components for improved performance
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Debounced search functionality

## Error Handling Strategy

1. **Validation Errors**: Clear field-level error messages
2. **Network Errors**: Retry mechanisms and fallback UI
3. **Database Errors**: User-friendly error messages
4. **Authorization Errors**: Proper redirect and messaging
5. **Unexpected Errors**: Error boundaries and logging

## Future Enhancements

- Employee photo upload
- Bulk import/export (CSV, Excel)
- Advanced filtering and search
- Employee hierarchy management
- Integration with payroll systems
- Audit trail for employee changes
